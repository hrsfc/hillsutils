# hrsfc-hillsutils

**HillsUtils** was a website and API to scrape [ProPortal](https://intranet.hrsfc.ac.uk/ProPortal/) for student timetables. It provided an `ical` endpoint for easy subscriptions in other applications, such as [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) or [Apple Calendar](https://www.icloud.com/calendar). This allowed a timetable that showed lessons, rooms (while respecting re-reroomings) and subject teachers. Additionally, subject codes could be translated into subject names transparently, providing better readability than ProPortal.

HillsUtils is no longer maintained, due to me graduating from Hills Road. I encourage any other students (or teachers!) to fork this. Similarly, if you're attending another school some minor code changes will likely be needed (I estimate login, subject names and endpoints will need updating) but maybe it'll be useful as a starting point.
